INTRODUCTION
This document serves as the project plan for the Laboratory Information Management System 
(LIMS) software development effort for ‘Sigma Labs & Medical Supplies’. Sigma Labs has been 
operating using a paper-based system for records. This project has been initiated to replace the 
current form of record keeping method with an information system that is integrated into upto-date data interoperability efforts, efficient and secure in order to better aid Sigma Labs’ 
mission.
The paper-based recording process is inept and tedious when it comes to receiving, tracking, 
reporting test results, and billing. This has greatly impacted the amount of time Sigma Labs has 
to service customers during the day and has, seemingly, caused prolonged workflow. The LIMS 
project will implement the ability to report testing results and easily share information between 
locations via electronic data transfer. The LIMS project will also enjoy the additional benefit of 
adding functionality based on modernized technology. This expected effort is to reduce the 
maintenance requirement for IT resources. (Sigma Labs has opted for this software company to 
handle maintenance of the system after implementation).
Objectives
This project plan will contain all of the information about the development plan and the 
development cycle. It will designate each member roles and responsibilities in terms of 
development as well as how and what methods they will utilize to accomplish their tasks. It will 
also set timelines to ensure that the project is completed on schedule. It will adhere to the 
standards stated in the most recent version of the SRS signed by the customer. The UI design 
will be included in the initial prototype. It will be able to show client prompted login, browse 
between different pages, contain the client's logo, and the remaining texts.
